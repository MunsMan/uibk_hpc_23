# Assignment 8

The goal of this assignment is to study the effect of one-sided communication.

## Exercise 1 (3 Points)

### Tasks

- Replace your two-sided communication in the n-body application of Assignment 6/7 with a one-sided implementation of your choice. Which one did you choose and why?
- Measure the speedup and efficiency for multiple problem and machine sizes as in previous exercises and compare to two-sided communication. Try to force stronger speedup effects by e.g. sending individual particles/forces in dedicated communication calls.
- Illustrate the data in appropriate figures and discuss them. What can you observe?
- Add the maximum number of particles that can be computed over 10000 timesteps in under 10 seconds into the comparison spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WIigEWPM3htroCkLbLoiVKf2x4J2PtxDbtuYUPTRQQ/edit.
